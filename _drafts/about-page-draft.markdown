This is a draft of my About page on the main website 

Who am I?
Beyond titles and professions, I am an intellectual. I am on a quest to search for knowledge across domains, with interests in markets, people, history, philosophy and psychology.

Introducing E-merging Billions Mega Theme 
    Mega-Theme Thesis: Income and therefore Wealth in emerging countries is expected to grow exceptionally quickly in the coming 10-15 years. This will lead to a burgenioning middle class in parts of Asia, Latam and Eastern Europe. 
    Certain industries such as Retail, Telecom, Banking and Transportation are exceptionally well positioned to modernize through technology and absorb that incremental wealth generation. 
    Workflow: 1. Macroeconomic research to understand what criteria correlate with the emerging nature of countries and what metrics predict income growth in a country - narrowed down to demographic trends like age and consumption preferences, political stability proxies, ease of doing business, FDI inflows and other related data.
    2. Understand how aspirational members to the middle class spend their incremental money once basics are covered to arrive at industry-level conviction. 
    3. Cross validate which of these industries are highly likley to see technology led innovation that is expected to a. materially increase the TAM, b. make these industries far more consumer centric, c. elimiate frictions and inefficienies in the economy and lastly d. is being mispriced by the market either through impact or time horizon. 

Launching Future of Retail 
    Workflow: Deeply understand the history, current developments and future of shopping. Focus on the various retail business models and arrive at what the future of technology enabled retail looks like in our chosen markets
    Initiated portfolio coverage on leading retailers such as MercadoLibre and Magazine Luiza in Latin America, Allegro in Eastern Europe and Reliance Digital in India. Each equity research report was an in-depth exploration of local industry trends, persistent consumption and shopping patterns and insight into the addressable market unlocked by new technology adoption. In addition to theme work, the report focuses on the security valuation and risks at the company, country and industry level.  

Other Importnant Work 
    Introduced FMC Corporation into the portfolio 
        Understood global crop protection industry and competitive dynamics, economics of patents and patent cliffs
    Introduced Accenture into the portfolio 
        Understood the IT consulting landscape and Global IT Spending, valuing people-centric businesses, the relationship between technology creators and implementors. 
        Initiated portfolio coverage of Tata Consultancy Services and in-depth understanding of their unique verticalized product offering portfolio as opposed to pure deal-by-deal offerings 

Investment Banking @ BNP Paribas, Singapore 
Biggest takeaway from the internship was understanding how banking works, the relationship between 'sell-side' and 'buy-side', the role investment banks play in financial markets and the importance of relationships in getting the job done. 
Specifically worked with the Equity Capital Markets team covering Asia Pacific to launch IPO of three Indian and Indonesian companies. Gave me an insider view on how capital is raised in a capitalist economy with insights on the role of key enabling players

Business Development @ Mobiliya Software Solutions 
Biggest takeaway was accepting "No, thanks". Accepting rejection, every day, all day. Mobiliya builds IoT, AI and ML solutions geared towards financial services, telecom and heavy industries. Busienss development is a fancy for cold-sales. Curating personalized product pitches and demos, targeting relevant companies and relevant decision makers in those companies with a personlized pitch was the job. Through relentless cold-calling and cold-emailing, I was able to generate multiple leads for our software solutions. 
Most importantly, I learned about AI and IoT solutions, how they worked and why they were important next steps in teh technology revolution before it became obvious. I also learned how to talk to strangers, present an agenda and sell software.
